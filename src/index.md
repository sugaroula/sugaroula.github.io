I am a MsC student in Theoretical Computer Science, with a focus on Distributed Algorithms.


# Education

- I am currently on my second year of the Parisian Research Master's in Computer Science (MPRI) at ENS Paris-Saclay
- I graduated valedictorian from University of Thessaly in 2024 with my BsC in Computer Science and Biomedical Informatics

# Internship

- I conducted a distributed computing research internship at the LISN laboratory in spring 2025, as part of the ParSys team. I as supervised by Janna Burman, and also collaborated with Evangelos Bampas and Joffroy Beauquier. I studied the fault tolerance of a mobile-agent model using volatile pheromone communication to solve the treasure hunt problem.
